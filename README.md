# Dimensionality reduction with PCA
## Objective
To classify each sample into types of species based on its attributes.

## Observations
- The model is better at classifying the data based on the cluster predicted class formed than the actual Species class.
- The accuracy for the cluster predicted class - 98.8% where as for the actual species class is 67.4%.
- From the predicted class classification report, can see class 0 and class 1 are with 100% precision and class 2 is 97% precision where as, from the actual class report, class 0 and class 1 are with 57% precision and class 2 is 89% precision is maximum we get there.
- And, The given data is experimented by labelling the data to a new class based on Flipper length column attribute, is classified than the originally classified datapoints.
